# CORS Setup

Proper CORS (Cross-origin Resource Sharing) configuration is important to ensure that the ConvoStack client is able to
connect to the backend GraphQL endpoint.

For details on how to setup CORS with Express and ConvoStack, check out [this section](../production/#cors-and-server-configurations) of the
production overview doc.
