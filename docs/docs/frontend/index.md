# ConvoStack Frontend

This documentation provides information about everything frontend-related for ConvoStack.

The ConvoStack frontend code can be found in the `convostack/frontend-react` package that comes when you `npm install convostack`.

In the package, you will find exported [React components](./fe-components) and the [useConvoStack() hook](./use-convostack-hook) to easily make API calls and handle state management.
