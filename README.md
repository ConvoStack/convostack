## What is ConvoStack?

ConvoStack is a plug and play embeddable AI chatbot widget and backend deployment framework for your website. **It is
completely free and open source and currently running on our [docs](https://docs.convostack.ai/) website!**

The core technologies are:

* React (frontend)
* Express.js (backend)
* Redis (Production cache & pub/sub)
* Langchain (AI agent framework integration)

To learn more about the project, compatible technologies, and how to get started, check out

## Getting Started

Get your AI chatbot up and running in minutes with our [quickstart guide](https://docs.convostack.ai/getting-started/):

In the following example, we are connecting a Langchain OpenAI [LLM](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/models/llms/) to the chatbot playground.

```typescript
import { playground } from "convostack/playground";
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

playground({
  reply(context: IAgentContext): Promise<IAgentResponse> {
    // `humanMessage` is the content of each message the user sends via the chatbot playground.
    let humanMessage = context.getHumanMessage().content;
    // `agent` is the OpenAI agent we want to use to respond to each `humanMessage`
    const agent = new OpenAI();
    // `call` is a simple string-in, string-out method for interacting with the OpenAI agent.
    const resp = await model.call(humanMessage);
    // `resp` is the generated agent's response to the user's `humanMessage`
    return {
      content: resp,
      contentType: "markdown",
    };
  },
});
```
